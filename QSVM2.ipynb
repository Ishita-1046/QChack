    "### This notebook aims to introduce the beginners to various concepts in Quantum Computing.This notebook is aimed for an audience who have a basic understanding of Machine Learning and wish to have a high level understanding of how Quantum Computing can impact Classical machine learning. First we introduce the concept of interference and discuss the role it plays in Quantum computing. We aim to give an overview of Quantum Computing and aim to explain the basic concept intuitively without excessive jargon. The aim of this project is to not overwhelm the beginners with intimidating mathematical equations but nonetheless provide them with at least basic understanding of fairly advanced Quantum Algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "First of all, let us see what interference is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interference is a phenomena in which two or more waves combine some parts and amplify or cancel each other out.\n",
    "This simply means that the positive amplitudes or crests amplify the resulting wave while positive and negative amplitudes cancel each other out.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fairly simple phenomena. The first level of complexity arises when we think about  the wave-particle theory of electrons which asserts that electrons are both particles and waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implications of this discovery are enormous. The double slit experiment conducted to show wave nature of electrons depicted an interference pattern when electrons were passed through a wall with two slits. The interference pattern confirms the wave nature of electrons.\n",
    "Now, how do we leverage this curious phenomena to our advantage? \n"

    "\n",
    "Now tighten your seatbelts people! Because this is where we say goodbye to Classical physics and delve into the world of Quantum. It's going to be a wild ride!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, There is another theory which some of you who are somewhat familiar with Quantum mechanics might have heard about. That is Superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superposition is a phenomena which states that any Quantum State can be represented as a combination of multiple states. Wild,right? Let’s take a step back to better understand this phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Classical state can be in a single state at a time. Like, if we talk about the bits in our computer then they can exist in either 0 or 1 state at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Quantum state on the other hand can be in multiple states at a time. A bit in a Quantum Computer called Qubit can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1 state. Simply, it means it exists in 0 and 1 state at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it then, Interference is just a byproduct of Superposition. Think about it. Look at this figure.\n"

    "When two waves interfere, the resultant state is a mixture of the previous two states. So now, the resultant wave  exists in both the initial states at the same time. This is a nice way to think about superposition.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we are talking about Quantum Computing, let’s talk about the role interference plays in Quantum Algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of most of the Quantum Algorithms is to bring all the qubits in an equal superposition state. And as we talked earlier, interference is a byproduct of superposition, so all the qubits attain a state where they are equally likely to measure any of the states. \n",
    "Further, we leverage interference to control the probability of measuring any one state over the other. This will be explained in the upcoming sections.\n"
